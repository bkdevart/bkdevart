## About ðŸ‘‹
Hi!  I'm Brandon, and I have a professional background in data analytics.  In recent years, I've become drawn to iOS development. 

I am currently interested in merging data with mobile apps, creating ML models that run on the phone and physics simluations that represent data.

Feel free to reach out to me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-knox-cs/)
