## About ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Brandon, and I have a professional background in both working and teaching data analytics. In recent years, I've broadened my skillset to include iOS development. I love being able to carry programs I'm writing in my pocket!

I am currently interested in merging data with mobile apps, creating ML models that run on the phone and physics simulations that represent data.

Feel free to reach out to me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-knox-cs/) or check out articles I've written on topics like these at [Medium](https://medium.com/@brandonknox_6151).
